    "##This is a demo of tha analysis that can be done with the behavioral_syntax Python 3 library which is based upon the ideas paper 'Changes in postural syntax characterize sensory modulation and natural variation of C. Elegans locomotion' co-authored by RF Shwarz, Andre Brown, William Schafer and many others. Here are the main ideas:\n",
    "1. animal tracking can increasingly be performed automatically but an outstanding challenge is finding ways to represent these behavioral data\n",
    "2. the following paper considers the idea that locomotion is driven by shape changes coordinated by the nervous system through time\n",
    "3. At any given moment the current worm posture can be approximated by the closest matching template from a pre-defined set of postures(i.e. kNN was used) obtained using K-means++ clustering. This is analogous to constructing a histogram where discrete bins are used to represent data drawn from a continuous distribution.\n",
    "4. With 90 template postures it's possible to capture around 83% of the postural variance and this opens up the possibility that NLP and bioinformatic methods can then be used to analyze worm locomotion. \n",
