1. Installation of Scientific Python Development Environment(Spyder)

- Python 3 is a programming language and interpreter(for executing computer programs) which is the biggest asset within Spyder.

- You can get all this(and more) for free if you follow these installation instructions: http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install.


2. Python programming references:

- assuming that you're not a python wizard here's a list of useful references: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/intro/learning/
- if you want something a bit less dry, you can try this great set of economics lessons(using Python): http://quant-econ.net/py/index.html

- I'm assuming that the user has a scientific background and is familiar with statistical methods.
